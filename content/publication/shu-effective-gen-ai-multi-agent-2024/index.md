abstract: 'AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities
  in problem solving. Through combining many intelligent agents, multi-agent collaboration
  has emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex, multi-faceted problems that
  exceed the capabilities of single AI agents. However, designing the collaboration
  protocols and evaluating the effectiveness of these systems remains a significant
  challenge, especially for enterprise applications. This report addresses these challenges
  by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of coordination and routing capabilities
  in a novel multi-agent collaboration framework. We evaluate two key operational
  modes: (1) a coordination mode enabling complex task completion through parallel
  communication and payload referencing, and (2) a routing mode for efficient message
  forwarding between agents. We benchmark on a set of handcrafted scenarios from three
  enterprise domains, which are publicly released with the report. For coordination
  capabilities, we demonstrate the effectiveness of inter-agent communication and
  payload referencing mechanisms, achieving end-to-end goal success rates of 90%.
  Our analysis yields several key findings: multi-agent collaboration enhances goal
  success rates by up to 70% compared to single-agent approaches in our benchmarks;
  payload referencing improves performance on code-intensive tasks by 23%; latency
  can be substantially reduced with a routing mechanism that selectively bypasses
  agent orchestration. These findings offer valuable guidance for enterprise deployments
  of multi-agent systems and advance the development of scalable, efficient multi-agent
  collaboration frameworks.'
