abstract: The application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in soccer
  offers numerous opportunities for sports analytics. Specifically, extracting audio
  commentaries with ASR provides valuable insights into the events of the game, and
  opens the door to several downstream applications such as automatic highlight generation.
  This paper presents SoccerNet-Echoes, an augmentation of the SoccerNet dataset with
  automatically generated transcriptions of audio commentaries from soccer game broadcasts,
  enhancing video content with rich layers of textual information derived from the
  game audio using ASR. These textual commentaries, generated using the Whisper model
  and translated with Google Translate, extend the usefulness of the SoccerNet dataset
  in diverse applications such as enhanced action spotting, automatic caption generation,
  and game summarization. By incorporating textual data alongside visual and auditory
  content, SoccerNet-Echoes aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for the development
  of algorithms specialized in capturing the dynamics of soccer games. We detail the
  methods involved in the curation of this dataset and the integration of ASR. We
  also highlight the implications of a multimodal approach in sports analytics, and
  how the enriched dataset can support diverse applications, thus broadening the scope
  of research and development in the field of sports analytics.
