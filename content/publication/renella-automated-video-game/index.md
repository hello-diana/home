abstract: In recent years, video game streaming has enjoyed ever-growing popularity.
  While streaming gameplay, a streamer is also expected to provide commentary on gameplay
  and otherwise entertain the audience. The mental burden for providing such commentary
  while also playing the game may provide a barrier of entry for new streamers. In
  this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate streaming commentary
  during gameplay for the game League of Legends. Our system recognizes key events,
  and uses generative AI services to generate voice output. We also present a preliminary
  evaluation of our system, both in quantitative terms of event recognition accuracy,
  as well as qualitatively by discussing the generated commentary.
