abstract: 'Recent advancements in AI-driven soccer understanding have demonstrated
  rapid progress, yet existing research predominantly focuses on isolated or narrow
  tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive framework for holistic soccer
  understanding. Specifically, we make the following contributions in this paper:
  (i) we construct SoccerWiki, the first large-scale multimodal soccer knowledge base,
  integrating rich domain knowledge about players, teams, referees, and venues to
  enable knowledge-driven reasoning; (ii) we present SoccerBench, the largest and
  most comprehensive soccer-specific benchmark, featuring around 10K standardized
  multimodal (text, image, video) multi-choice QA pairs across 13 distinct understanding
  tasks, curated through automated pipelines and manual verification; (iii) we introduce
  SoccerAgent, a novel multi-agent system that decomposes complex soccer questions
  via collaborative reasoning, leveraging domain expertise from SoccerWiki and achieving
  robust performance; (iv) extensive evaluations and ablations that benchmark state-of-the-art
  MLLMs on SoccerBench, highlighting the superiority of our proposed agentic system.
