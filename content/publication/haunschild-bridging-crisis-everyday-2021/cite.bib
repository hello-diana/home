 abstract = {During a dynamic and protracted crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens are continuously challenged with making decisions under uncertainty. In addition to evaluating the risk of their behaviors to themselves and others, citizens also have to consider the most current regulation, which often varies federally and locally and by incidence numbers. Few tools help to stay informed about the current rules. The state-run German multi-hazard warning app NINA incorporated a feature for COVID-19, while two apps, DarfIchDas and CoroBuddy, focus only on COVID-19 regulation and are privately run. To investigate users' expectations, perceived advantages, and gaps as well as the developers' challenges, we analyze recent app store reviews of the apps and developers' replies. We show that the warning app and the COVID-19 regulation apps are evaluated on different terms, that the correctness and portrayal of complex rules are the main challenges and that developers and editors are underusing users' potential for crowdsourcing.},
