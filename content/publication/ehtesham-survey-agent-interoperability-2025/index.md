abstract: 'Large language model powered autonomous agents demand robust, standardized
  protocols to integrate tools, share contextual data, and coordinate tasks across
  heterogeneous systems. Ad-hoc integrations are difficult to scale, secure, and generalize
  across domains. This survey examines four emerging agent communication protocols:
  Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent
  Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability
  in deployment contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure
  tool invocation and typed data exchange. ACP defines a general-purpose communication
  protocol over RESTful HTTP, supporting MIME-typed multipart messages and synchronous
  and asynchronous interactions. Its lightweight and runtime-independent design enables
  scalable agent invocation, while features like session management, message routing,
  and integration with role-based and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). A2A enables
  peer-to-peer task delegation using capability-based Agent Cards, supporting secure
  and scalable collaboration across enterprise agent workflows. ANP supports open
  network agent discovery and secure collaboration using W3C decentralized identifiers
  DIDs and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions,
  including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and security
  models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap is proposed:
  beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for structured, multimodal messaging
  session-aware interaction and both online and offline agent discovery across scalable,
  HTTP-based deployments A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP
  for decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation
  for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered agents.'
