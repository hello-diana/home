abstract: Peer review is fundamental to the integrity and advancement of scientific
  publication. Traditional methods of peer review analyses often rely on exploration
  and statistics of existing peer review data, which do not adequately address the
  multivariate nature of the process, account for the latent variables, and are further
  constrained by privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data. We introduce
  AgentReview, the first large language model (LLM) based peer review simulation framework,
  which effectively disentangles the impacts of multiple latent factors and addresses
  the privacy issue. Our study reveals significant insights, including a notable 37.1%
  variation in paper decisions due to reviewers' biases, supported by sociological
  theories such as the social influence theory, altruism fatigue, and authority bias.
  We believe that this study could offer valuable insights to improve the design of
  peer review mechanisms.
