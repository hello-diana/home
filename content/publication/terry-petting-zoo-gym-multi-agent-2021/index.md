abstract: This paper introduces the PettingZoo library and the accompanying Agent
  Environment Cycle (\"AEC\") games model. PettingZoo is a library of diverse sets
  of multi-agent environments with a universal, elegant Python API. PettingZoo was
  developed with the goal of accelerating research in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  (\"MARL\"), by making work more interchangeable, accessible and reproducible akin
  to what OpenAI's Gym library did for single-agent reinforcement learning. PettingZoo's
  API, while inheriting many features of Gym, is unique amongst MARL APIs in that
  it's based around the novel AEC games model. We argue, in part through case studies
  on major problems in popular MARL environments, that the popular game models are
  poor conceptual models of the games commonly used with MARL, that they promote severe
  bugs that are hard to detect, and that the AEC games model addresses these problems.
