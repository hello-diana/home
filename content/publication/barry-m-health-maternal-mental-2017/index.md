abstract: 'Health and wellbeing applications increasingly raise ethical issues for
  design. User-centred and participatory design approaches, while grounded in everyday
  wisdom, cannot be expected to address ethical reflection consistently, as multiple
  value systems come into play. We explore the potential of phronesis, a concept from
  Aristotelian virtue ethics, for mHealth design. Phronesis describes wisdom and judgment
  garnered from practical experience of specific situations in context. Applied phronesis
  contributes everyday wisdom to challenging issues for vulnerable target users. Drawing
  on research into mHealth technologies for psychological wellbeing, we explore how
  phronesis can inform ethical design. Using a case study on an app for selfreporting
  symptoms of depression during pregnancy, we present a framework for incorporating
  a phronetic approach into design, involving: (a) a wide feedback net to capture
  phronetic input early in design; (b) observing the order of feedback, which directly
  affects value priorities in design; (c) ethical pluralism recognising different
  coexisting value systems; (d) acknowledging subjectivity in the disclosure and recognition
  of individual researcher and participant values. We offer insights into how a phronetic
  approach can contribute everyday wisdom to designing mHealth technologies to help
  designers foster the values that promote human flourishing.'
