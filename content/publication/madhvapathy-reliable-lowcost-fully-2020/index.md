abstract: Present-day dermatological diagnostic tools are expensive, time-consuming,
  require substantial operational expertise, and typically probe only the superficial
  layers of skin (~15 $μ$m). We introduce a soft, battery-free, noninvasive, reusable
  skin hydration sensor (SHS) adherable to most of the body surface. The platform
  measures volumetric water content (up to ~1 mm in depth) and wirelessly transmits
  data to any near-field communication--compatible smartphone. The SHS is readily
  manufacturable, comprises unique powering and encapsulation strategies, and achieves
  high measurement precision (textpm5% volumetric water content) and resolution (textpm0.015$^∘$C
  skin surface temperature). Validation on n = 16 healthy/normal human participants
  reveals an average skin water content of ~63% across multiple body locations. Pilot
  studies on patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriasis, urticaria, xerosis cutis,
  and rosacea highlight the diagnostic capability of the SHS (PAD = 0.0034) and its
  ability to study impact of topical treatments on skin diseases.
