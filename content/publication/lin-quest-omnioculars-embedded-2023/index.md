abstract: Sports game data is becoming increasingly complex, often consisting of multivariate
  data such as player performance stats, historical team records, and athletes' positional
  tracking information. While numerous visual analytics systems have been developed
  for sports analysts to derive insights, few tools target fans to improve their understanding
  and engagement of sports data during live games. By presenting extra data in the
  actual game views, embedded visualization has the potential to enhance fans' game-viewing
  experience. However, little is known about how to design such kinds of visualizations
  embedded into live games. In this work, we present a user-centered design study
  of developing interactive embedded visualizations for basketball fans to improve
  their live game-watching experiences. We first conducted a formative study to characterize
  basketball fans' in-game analysis behaviors and tasks. Based on our findings, we
  propose a design framework to inform the design of embedded visualizations based
  on specific data-seeking contexts. Following the design framework, we present five
  novel embedded visualization designs targeting five representative contexts identified
  by the fans, including shooting, offense, defense, player evaluation, and team comparison.
  We then developed Omnioculars, an interactive basketball game-viewing prototype
  that features the proposed embedded visualizations for fans' in-game data analysis.
  We evaluated Omnioculars in a simulated basketball game with basketball fans. The
  study results suggest that our design supports personalized in-game data analysis
  and enhances game understanding and engagement.
