abstract: We introduce--aSpire--a clippable, mobile pneumatic-haptic device designed
  to help users regulate their breathing rate via subtle tactile feedback. aSpire
  can be easily clipped to a strap/belt and used to personalize tactile stimulation
  patterns, intensity, and frequency via its array of air pouch actuators that infate/defate
  individually. To evaluate the efectiveness of aSpire's diferent tactile stimulation
  patterns in guiding the breathing rate of people on the move, outof-lab environment,
  we conducted a user study with car passengers in a real-world commuting setting.
  The results show that engaging with the aSpire does not evoke extra mental stress,
  and helps the participants reduce their average breathing rate while keeping their
  perceived pleasantness and energy level high.
