abstract: Ubiquitous computing requires robust and sustainable sensing techniques
  to detect users for explicit and implicit inputs. Existing solutions with cameras
  can be privacy-invasive. Battery-powered sensors require user maintenance, preventing
  practical ubiquitous sensor deployment. We present OptoSense, a general-purpose
  self-powered sensing system which senses ambient light at the surface level of everyday
  objects as a high-fidelity signal to infer user activities and interactions. To
  situate the novelty of OptoSense among prior work and highlight the generalizability
  of the approach, we propose a design framework of ambient light sensing surfaces,
  enabling implicit activity sensing and explicit interactions in a wide range of
  use cases with varying sensing dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D), fields of view (wide, narrow),
  and perspectives (egocentric, allocentric). OptoSense supports this framework through
  example applications ranging from object use and indoor traffic detection, to liquid
  sensing and multitouch input. Additionally, the system can achieve high detection
  accuracy while being self-powered by ambient light. On-going improvements that replace
  Optosense's silicon-based sensors with organic semiconductors (OSCs) enable devices
  that are ultra-thin, flexible, and cost effective to scale.
