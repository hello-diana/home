abstract: We present iBall, a basketball video-watching system that leverages gaze-moderated
  embedded visualizations to facilitate game understanding and engagement of casual
  fans. Video broadcasting and online video platforms make watching basketball games
  increasingly accessible. Yet, for new or casual fans, watching basketball videos
  is often confusing due to their limited basketball knowledge and the lack of accessible,
  on-demand information to resolve their confusion. To assist casual fans in watching
  basketball videos, we compared the game-watching behaviors of casual and die-hard
  fans in a formative study and developed iBall based on the fndings. iBall embeds
  visualizations into basketball videos using a computer vision pipeline, and automatically
  adapts the visualizations based on the game context and users' gaze, helping casual
  fans appreciate basketball games without being overwhelmed. We confrmed the usefulness,
  usability, and engagement of iBall in a study with 16 casual fans, and further collected
  feedback from 8 die-hard fans.
