abstract: 'Qualitative research explores complex phenomena encountered by clinicians,
  health care providers, policy makers and consumers. Although partial checklists
  are available, no consolidated reporting framework exists for any type of qualitative
  design.To develop a checklist for explicit and comprehensive reporting of qualitative
  studies (indepth interviews and focus groups).We performed a comprehensive search
  in Cochrane and Campbell Protocols, Medline, CINAHL, systematic reviews of qualitative
  studies, author or reviewer guidelines of major medical journals and reference lists
  of relevant publications for existing checklists used to assess qualitative studies.
  Seventy-six items from 22 checklists were compiled into a comprehensive list. All
  items were grouped into three domains: (i) research team and reflexivity, (ii) study
  design and (iii) data analysis and reporting. Duplicate items and those that were
  ambiguous, too broadly defined and impractical to assess were removed.Items most
  frequently included in the checklists related to sampling method, setting for data
  collection, method of data collection, respondent validation of findings, method
  of recording data, description of the derivation of themes and inclusion of supporting
  quotations. We grouped all items into three domains: (i) research team and reflexivity,
  (ii) study design and (iii) data analysis and reporting.The criteria included in
  COREQ, a 32-item checklist, can help researchers to report important aspects of
  the research team, study methods, context of the study, findings, analysis and interpretations.'
