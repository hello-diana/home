abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease leading
  to the irreversible loss of brain neurons and cognitive abilities, and the vicious
  interplay between oxidative stress (OS) and tauopathy is believed to be one of the
  major players in AD development. Here, we demonstrated the capability of the small
  molecule N-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-[5-chloro-2-methoxy(phenylsulfonyl)anilino]acetamide
  (LX2343) to ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction of AD model rats by inhibiting
  OS-induced neuronal apoptosis and tauopathy. Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce
  OS in neuronal cells in vitro and in AD model rats that were made by intracerebroventricular
  injection of STZ (3 mg/kg, bilaterally), and Morris water maze test was used to
  evaluate the cognitive dysfunction in ICV-STZ rats. Treatment with LX2343 (5--20
  $μ$mol/L) significantly attenuated STZ-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells and mouse
  primary cortical neurons by alleviating OS and inhibiting the JNK/p38 and pro-apoptotic
  pathways. LX2343 was able to restore the integrity of mitochondrial function and
  morphology, increase ATP biosynthesis, and reduce ROS accumulation in the neuronal
  cells. In addition, LX2343 was found to be a non-ATP competitive GSK-3$β$ inhibitor
  with IC50 of 1.84textpm0.07 $μ$mol/L, and it potently inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation
  in the neuronal cells. In ICV-STZ rats, administration of LX2343 (7, 21 mg$·$kg-1$·$d-1,
  ip, for 5 weeks) efficiently improved their cognitive deficits. LX2343 ameliorates
  the cognitive dysfunction in the AD model rats by suppressing OS-induced neuronal
  apoptosis and tauopathy, thus highlighting the potential of LX2343 for the treatment
  of AD.
