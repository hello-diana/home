abstract: 'Recent integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multimodal
  models has advanced the field of sports analytics. This survey presents a comprehensive
  review of the datasets and applications driving these innovations post-2020. We
  overviewed and categorized datasets into three primary types: language-based, multimodal,
  and convertible datasets. Language-based and multimodal datasets are for tasks involving
  text or multimodality (e.g., text, video, audio), respectively. Convertible datasets,
  initially single-modal (video), can be enriched with additional annotations, such
  as explanations of actions and video descriptions, to become multimodal, offering
  future potential for richer and more diverse applications. Our study highlights
  the contributions of these datasets to various applications, from improving fan
  experiences to supporting tactical analysis and medical diagnostics. We also discuss
  the challenges and future directions in dataset development, emphasizing the need
  for diverse, high-quality data to support real-time processing and personalized
  user experiences. This survey provides a foundational resource for researchers and
  practitioners aiming to leverage NLP and multimodal models in sports, offering insights
  into current trends and future opportunities in the field.'
