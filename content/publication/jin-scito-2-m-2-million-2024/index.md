abstract: 'Understanding the creation, evolution, and dissemination of scientific
  knowledge is crucial for bridging diverse subject areas and addressing complex global
  challenges such as pandemics, climate change, and ethical AI. Scientometrics, the
  quantitative and qualitative study of scientific literature, provides valuable insights
  into these processes. We introduce Scito2M, a longitudinal scientometric dataset
  with over two million academic publications, providing comprehensive contents information
  and citation graphs to support cross-disciplinary analyses. Using Scito2M, we conduct
  a temporal study spanning over 30 years to explore key questions in scientometrics:
  the evolution of academic terminology, citation patterns, and interdisciplinary
  knowledge exchange. Our findings reveal critical insights, such as disparities in
  epistemic cultures, knowledge production modes, and citation practices. For example,
  rapidly developing, application-driven fields like LLMs exhibit significantly shorter
  citation age (2.48 years) compared to traditional theoretical disciplines like oral
  history (9.71 years).'
