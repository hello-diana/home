abstract: Pregnancy brings physical, emotional, and economic challenges for expectant
  parent(s), close relatives, and friends. Existing technology support, including
  tracking technology, largely targets pregnant people and ignores other stakeholders.
  We therefore lack an understanding of how to approach designing collaborative pregnancy
  tracking technology. To understand how people collaborate around pregnancy tracking
  and wish to do so, we interviewed 13 pregnant people and 11 non-pregnant stakeholders
  in the U.S., including partners, friends, and grandparents-to-be. We find that people
  collaborate for goals like social bonding and jointly managing various pregnancy
  data. Stakeholders collaborated by either dividing up data types or collectively
  monitoring the same information. We also identify tensions and challenges, such
  as pregnant people's privacy concerns and stakeholders' varied levels of interest
  in tracking. In light of socio-cultural norms and stakeholders' distinctive roles
  around pregnancy, we point to opportunities for designing collaborative technology
  that aligns with as well as challenges socio-cultural practices around pregnancy
  tracking.
