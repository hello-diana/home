abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enormous
  potential for automation. Early proof of this technology can be found in various
  demonstrations of agents solving complex tasks, interacting with external systems
  to augment their knowledge, and triggering actions. In particular, workflows involving
  multiple agents solving complex tasks in a collaborative fashion exemplify their
  capacity to operate in less strict and less well-defined environments. Thus, a multi-agent
  approach has great potential for serving as a backbone in many industrial applications,
  ranging from complex knowledge retrieval systems to next generation robotic process
  automation. Given the reasoning abilities within the current generation of LLMs,
  complex processes require a multi-step approach that includes a plan of well-defined
  and modular tasks. Depending on the level of complexity, these tasks can be executed
  either by a single agent or a group of agents. In this work, we focus on designing
  a flexible agent engineering framework with careful attention to planning and execution,
  capable of handling complex use case applications across various domains. The proposed
  framework provides reliability in industrial applications and presents techniques
  to ensure a scalable, flexible, and collaborative workflow for multiple autonomous
  agents working together towards solving tasks.
