abstract: Counting mosquitoes in the wild is a crucial capability for monitoring,
  prediction, and control of vector-borne diseases. Current approaches are mainly
  manual, where specially designed mosquito traps or ovitraps are placed in areas
  of interest and recovered the next day. The counting itself is performed in an entomological
  laboratory, where individual mosquitoes are classified into species and counted.
  This process is costly, slow and inefficient. At the same time, mosquito counting
  is most relevant in tropical and sub-tropical countries, where mosquitoes spread
  deadly diseases like malaria, yellow fever and dengue fever. Many countries in these
  regions have relatively weak public health systems and so cannot support large-scale
  vector counting efforts. In this paper, we present a system architecture and a prototype
  to count mosquitoes in the wild with an Internet of Things approach. A sensor board
  is developed to gather audio data, and models are developed to detect, classify,
  and count mosquito species. Here, we present our prototype and an extensive background
  study of classifying mosquitoes based on sound recordings and some preliminary results
  and discussion.
