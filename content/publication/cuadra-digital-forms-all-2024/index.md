abstract: Digital forms help us access services and opportunities, but they are not
  equally accessible to everyone, such as older adults or those with sensory impairments.
  Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal interfaces offer a unique opportunity
  to increase form accessibility. Informed by prior literature and needfinding, we
  built a holistic multimodal LLM agent for health data entry. We describe the process
  of designing and building our system, and the results of a study with older adults
  (N =10). All participants, regardless of age or disability status, were able to
  complete a standard 47-question form independently using our system---one blind
  participant said it was \"a prayer answered.\" Our video analysis revealed how different
  modalities provided alternative interaction paths in complementary ways (e.g., the
  buttons helped resolve transcription errors and speech helped provide more options
  when the pre-canned answer choices were insufficient). We highlight key design guidelines,
  such as designing systems that dynamically adapt to individual needs.
