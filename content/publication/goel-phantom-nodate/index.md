abstract: Testing sensors on human subjects is fraught with challenges such as extensive
  setup times and inconsistent data collection. This study explores the use of phantom
  organs as a solution to streamline sensor testing and validation. By replicating
  essential organ functions, phantom organs can provide a consistent and repeatable
  testing environment, improving data accuracy and reliability. Our development of
  a phantom lung, capable of emulating human breathing patterns, exemplifies this
  approach. This phantom lung could facilitate the testing of ENDS monitoring sensors,
  allowing for the safe and controlled simulation of smoking combustible and electronic
  cigarettes. The use of phantom organs not only reduces reliance on human subjects
  in sensor development but also fosters innovation by allowing experimentation with
  novel sensing mechanisms. This research highlights the potential of phantom organs
  to revolutionize sensor testing practices, ultimately accelerating the advancement
  of sensing technologies in various fields.
