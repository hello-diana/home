abstract: Video understanding technology has become increasingly important in various
  disciplines, yet current approaches have primarily focused on lower comprehension
  level of video content, posing challenges for providing comprehensive and professional
  insights at a higher comprehension level. Video analysis plays a crucial role in
  athlete training and strategy development in racket sports. This study aims to demonstrate
  an innovative and higher-level video comprehension framework (ChatMatch), which
  integrates computer vision technologies with the cutting-edge large language models
  (LLM) to enable intelligent analysis and inference of racket sports videos. To examine
  the feasibility of this framework, we deployed a prototype of ChatMatch in the badminton
  in this study. A vision-based encoder was first proposed to extract the meta-features
  included the locations, actions, gestures, and action results of players in each
  frame of racket match videos, followed by a rule-based decoding method to transform
  the extracted information in both structured knowledge and unstructured knowledge.
  A set of LLM-based agents included namely task identifier, coach agent, statistician
  agent, and video manager, was developed through a prompt engineering and driven
  by an automated mechanism. The automatic collaborative interaction among the agents
  enabled the provision of a comprehensive response to professional inquiries from
  users. The validation findings showed that our vision models had excellent performances
  in meta-feature extraction, achieving a location identification accuracy of 0.991,
  an action recognition accuracy of 0.902, and a gesture recognition accuracy of 0.950.
  Additionally, a total of 100 questions were gathered from four proficient badminton
  players and one coach to evaluate the performance of the LLM-based agents, and the
  outcomes obtained from ChatMatch exhibited commendable results across general inquiries,
  statistical queries, and video retrieval tasks. These findings highlight the potential
  of using this approach that can offer valuable insights for athletes and coaches
  while significantly improve the efficiency of sports video analysis.
