abstract: 'We present a novel digital humanities method for representing our Twitch
  chatters as user embeddings created by a large language model (LLM). We cluster
  these embeddings automatically using affinity propagation and further narrow this
  clustering down through manual analysis. We analyze the chat of one stream by each
  Twitch streamer: SmallAnt, DougDoug and PointCrow. Our findings suggest that each
  streamer has their own type of chatters, however two categories emerge for all of
  the streamers: supportive viewers and emoji and reaction senders. Repetitive message
  spammers is a shared chatter category for two of the streamers.'
