abstract: This paper explores the open research problem of understanding the social
  behaviors of LLM-based agents. Using Avalon as a testbed, we employ system prompts
  to guide LLM agents in gameplay. While previous studies have touched on gameplay
  with LLM agents, research on their social behaviors is lacking. We propose a novel
  framework, tailored for Avalon, features a multi-agent system facilitating efficient
  communication and interaction. We evaluate its performance based on game success
  and analyze LLM agents' social behaviors. Results affirm the framework`s effectiveness
  in creating adaptive agents and suggest LLM-based agents' potential in navigating
  dynamic social interactions. By examining collaboration and confrontation behaviors,
  we offer insights into this field`s research and applications.
