 abstract = {This paper explores the open research problem of understanding the social behaviors of LLM-based agents. Using Avalon as a testbed, we employ system prompts to guide LLM agents in gameplay. While previous studies have touched on gameplay with LLM agents, research on their social behaviors is lacking. We propose a novel framework, tailored for Avalon, features a multi-agent system facilitating efficient communication and interaction. We evaluate its performance based on game success and analyze LLM agents' social behaviors. Results affirm the framework`s effectiveness in creating adaptive agents and suggest LLM-based agents' potential in navigating dynamic social interactions. By examining collaboration and confrontation behaviors, we offer insights into this field`s research and applications.},
