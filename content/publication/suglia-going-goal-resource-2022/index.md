abstract: "Recent video+language datasets cover domains where the interaction is highly
  structured, such as instructional videos, or where the interaction is scripted,
  such as TV shows. Both of these properties can lead to spurious cues to be exploited
  by models rather than learning to ground language. In this paper, we present GrOunded
  footbAlL commentaries (GOAL), a novel dataset of football (or `soccer') highlights
  videos with transcribed live commentaries in English. As the course of a game is
  unpredictable, so are commentaries, which makes them a unique resource to investigate
  dynamic language grounding. We also provide state-of-the-art baselines for the following
  tasks: frame reordering, moment retrieval, live commentary retrieval and play-by-play
  live commentary generation. Results show that SOTA models perform reasonably well
  in most tasks. We discuss the implications of these results and suggest new tasks
  for which GOAL can be used. Our codebase is available at: https://gitlab.com/grounded-sport-convai/goal-baselines."
