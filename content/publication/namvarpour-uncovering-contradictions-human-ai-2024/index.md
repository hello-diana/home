abstract: The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life
  presents opportunities and challenges, particularly in fostering human-AI relationships.
  This study investigates user reviews from the Google Play Store for the Replika
  chatbot, focusing on complaints of online sexual harassment. Using Activity Theory,
  the analysis reveals several contradictions within the Replika activity system,
  including tool-subject, tool-object, rule-subject, rule-object, and distribution
  of labor-subject and labor-object contradictions. These contradictions highlight
  the misalignment between user expectations and the chatbot's behavior, inadequate
  safety measures, and unrealistic expectations placed on users to train the AI. The
  study emphasizes the need for clearer objectives, advanced AI alignment techniques,
  and refined safety protocols to enhance the user experience and ensure ethical interactions
  with chatbots. We provide implications for guidelines on the development of more
  trustworthy and supportive digital companions.
