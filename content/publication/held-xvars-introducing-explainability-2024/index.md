abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to significant
  improvements in automated decision-making. However, the increased performance of
  models often comes at the cost of explainability and transparency of their decision-making
  processes. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of large language models
  to explain decisions, using football refereeing as a testing ground, given its decision
  complexity and subjectivity. We introduce the EXplainable Video Assistant Referee
  System, X-VARS, a multi-modal large language model designed for understanding football
  videos from the point of view of a referee. X-VARS can perform a multitude of tasks,
  including video description, question answering, action recognition, and conducting
  meaningful conversations based on video content and in accordance with the Laws
  of the Game for football referees. We validate X-VARS on our novel dataset, SoccerNet-XFoul,
  which consists of more than 22k videoquestion-answer triplets annotated by over
  70 experienced football referees. Our experiments and human study illustrate the
  impressive capabilities of X-VARS in interpreting complex football clips. Furthermore,
  we highlight the potential of X-VARS to reach human performance and support football
  referees in the future. We will provide code, model, dataset, and demo upon publication.
