abstract: Conventional vision-based systems, such as cameras, have demonstrated their
  enormous versatility in sensing human activities and developing interactive environments.
  However, these systems have long been criticized for incurring privacy, power, and
  latency issues due to their underlying structure of pixel-wise analog signal acquisition,
  computation, and communication. In this research, we overcome these limitations
  by introducing in-sensor analog computation through the distribution of interconnected
  photodetectors in space, having a weighted responsivity, to create what we call
  a computational photodetector. Computational photodetectors can be used to extract
  mid-level vision features as a single continuous analog signal measured via a two-pin
  connection. We develop computational photodetectors using thin and flexible low-noise
  organic photodiode arrays coupled with a self-powered wireless system to demonstrate
  a set of designs that capture position, orientation, direction, speed, and identification
  information, in a range of applications from explicit interactions on everyday surfaces
  to implicit activity detection.
