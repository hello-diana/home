abstract: Relative to in-person meetings, conversations in video meetings have long
  been reported as stilted. Spatial audio in video meetings can simulate the way we
  hear the world by separating audio streams based on speakers' virtual locations.
  We report on a within-subject experiment in which 75 employees of a global technology
  company completed two group survival tasks with spatial audio enabled or disabled.
  Spatial audio increased perceptions of interactivity, shared space, and ease of
  understanding. Women experienced effects for social presence while men experienced
  effects for turn-taking. We discuss implications for inclusion, task performance,
  fatigue, and future research.
