abstract: Developing chatbots as personal companions has long been a goal of artificial
  intelligence researchers. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered
  a practical solution for endowing chatbots with anthropomorphic language capabilities.
  However, it takes more than LLMs to enable chatbots that can act as companions.
  Humans use their understanding of individual personalities to drive conversations.
  Chatbots also require this capability to enable human-like companionship. They should
  act based on personalized, real-time, and time-evolving knowledge of their users.
  We define such essential knowledge as the common ground between chatbots and their
  users, and we propose to build a common-ground-aware dialogue system from an LLM-based
  module, named OS-1, to enable chatbot companionship. Hosted by eyewear, OS-1 can
  sense the visual and audio signals the user receives and extract real-time contextual
  semantics. Those semantics are categorized and recorded to formulate historical
  contexts from which the user's profile is distilled and evolves over time, i.e.,
  OS-1 gradually learns about its user. OS-1 combines knowledge from real-time semantics,
  historical contexts, and user-specific profiles to produce a common-ground-aware
  prompt input into the LLM module. The LLM's output is converted to audio, spoken
  to the wearer when appropriate. We conduct laboratory and in-field studies to assess
  OS-1's ability to build common ground between the chatbot and its user. The technical
  feasibility and capabilities of the system are also evaluated. Our results show
  that by utilizing personal context, OS-1 progressively develops a better understanding
  of its users. This enhances user satisfaction and potentially leads to various personal
  service scenarios, such as emotional support and assistance.
