abstract: We conducted a structured, qualitative feature analysis of 75 Android mobile
  apps designed for the purpose of promoting adolescent online safety. Through this
  analysis we identified 42 unique features that mapped to a theoretically derived
  conceptual framework of teen online safety strategies balanced between parental
  control strategies (through monitoring, restriction, and active mediation) and teen
  self-regulation strategies (through self-monitoring, impulse control, and risk-coping).
  We found that the apps strongly favored features that promote parental control through
  monitoring and restricting teens' online behaviors over teen self-regulation or
  more communicative and collaborative practices between parents and teens. We use
  the lens of value sensitive design to discuss the implications of our results and
  identify opportunities for designing mobile apps for online safety that embed more
  positive family values.
