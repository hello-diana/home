abstract: Randomized control trials (RCT's) are the gold standard in evaluating and
  efficiently translating research data into clinical practice. The CONSORT statement
  was conceptualized in order to help ascertain standardization and reproducibility
  of RCT's. The articles publishing the CONSORT 2010 statement along with their bibliographies
  were identified and thoroughly reviewed. The CONSORT statement is made up of a 25-item
  checklist that provides the author with a solid backbone around which to construct
  and present an RCT. It sets standards on the trial's design, analysis, and interpretation
  of the results.
