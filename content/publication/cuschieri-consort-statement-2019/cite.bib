 abstract = {Randomized control trials (RCT's) are the gold standard in evaluating and efficiently translating research data into clinical practice. The CONSORT statement was conceptualized in order to help ascertain standardization and reproducibility of RCT's. The articles publishing the CONSORT 2010 statement along with their bibliographies were identified and thoroughly reviewed. The CONSORT statement is made up of a 25-item checklist that provides the author with a solid backbone around which to construct and present an RCT. It sets standards on the trial's design, analysis, and interpretation of the results.},
